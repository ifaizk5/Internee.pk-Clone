           Latches

          A latch is a temporary storage device that has two stable
          states (bistable). It is a basic form of memory.
          The S-R (Set-Reset) latch is the most basic type. It can be constructed
          from NOR gates or NAND gates. With NOR gates, the latch responds
          to active-HIGH inputs; with NAND gates, it responds to active-LOW
          inputs.

          Latches
          The active-HIGH S-R latch is in a stable (latched) condition
          when both inputs are LOW.
           Assume the latch is initially RESET
           (Q = 0) and the inputs are at their
           inactive level (0). To SET the latch
           (Q = 1), a momentary HIGH signal
           is applied to the S input while the R
           remains LOW.

               A simple rule for the D latch is:
                      Q follows D when the Enable is active.

           Flip-flops
               A flip-flop differs from a latch in the manner it changes
               states. A flip-flop is a clocked device, in which only the
               clock edge determines when a new bit is entered.
               The active edge can be positive or negative.

            The truth table for a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop
            shows an up arrow to remind you that it is sensitive to its
            D input only on the rising edge of the clock; otherwise it is
            latched. The truth table for a negative-edge triggered D
            flip-flop is identical except for the direction of the arrow.

            The J-K flip-flop is more versatile than the D flip flop. In
            addition to the clock input, it has two inputs, labeled J and
            K. When both J and K = 1, the output changes states
            (toggles) on the active clock edge (in this case, the rising
            edge).

           Flip-flops

            A D-flip-flop does not have a toggle mode like the J-K flip-
            flop, but you can hardwire a toggle mode by connecting Q
            back to D as shown. This is useful in some counters as you
            will see in Chapter 8.
                                                                             D                   Q

             For example, if Q is LOW, Q is               CLK                 CLK
             HIGH and the flip-flop will toggle
             on the next clock edge. Because the                                                Q
             flip-flop only changes on the active
             edge, the output will only change
             once for each clock pulse.

           Flip-flops

             Synchronous and Asynchronous Inputs:
             Synchronous inputs are transferred in the triggering edge
             of the clock (for example the D or J-K inputs). Most flip-
             flops have other inputs that are asynchronous, meaning
                                                         PRE
             they affect the output independent of the clock.
             Two such inputs are normally labeled                           J                  Q
             preset (PRE) and clear (CLR). These

             inputs are usually active LOW. A J-K

           Flip-flop Characteristics
          Propagation delay time is specified for the rising and
          falling outputs. It is measured between the 50% level of the
          clock to the 50% level of the output transition.

           The typical propagation delay time for the 74AHC family (CMOS) is
           4 ns. Even faster logic is available for specialized applications.

          Another propagation delay time specification is the time
          required for an asynchronous input to cause a change in the
          output. Again it is measured from the 50% levels. The
          74AHC family has specified delay times under 5 ns.

           Flip-flop Applications

           For frequency division, it is simple to use a flip-flop in
           the toggle mode or to chain a series of toggle flip flops to
           continue to divide by two.      HIGH         HIGH

           One flip-flop will divide fin
                                                                  J    QA                 J    QB           fout
           by 2, two flip-flops will
           divide fin by 4 (and so on).              fin              CLK                     CLK
           A side benefit of frequency
           division is that the output                            K                       K
           has an exact 50% duty
